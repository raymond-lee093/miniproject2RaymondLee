# Mini Project 2

## Description

This project will use a dataset found on kaggle to get information on Valentine's Day Consumer Data.
Using Pandas, the data will be put into dataframes. The data will then be imported from 1 of 3 csv files. 
The program will use Matplotlib and manipulate the data in order to create 5 graphs that output as PNG
files in the "charts" folder.The graphs that will be created are a line graph, bar graph, scatter plot graph,
and 2 subplot graphs. The line graph uses a csv file, the bar graph and scatter plot use the same csv file, and 
the subplot graphs use a csv file. All 3 cvs files are used from the dataset in the program. The data will answer
the question "What is the primary expenditure for Valentine's Day among Americans from 2010 to 2022?"
